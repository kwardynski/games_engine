# GamesEngine

Elixir library with utilities for games, such as helpful coordinate conversions (for now).

---

Apologies to anyone who's using this library at the moment as it will likely be very volatile for the forseeable future. I am still converging on naming conventions and argument syntax, and there will almost certainly be many breaking changes while I fine-tune this library as I integrate it into my projects.

Any suggestions are welcome!

## Installation

This package is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/games_engine), and can be installed
by adding `games_engine` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:games_engine, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/games_engine), but is still a work in progress.
